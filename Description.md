## How to build API route in next.js:

create a api/test folder inside the app directory:

app/api/test/route.ts

  export const GET = () => { return NextResponse.json({ "this is a GET method" }) }

to send parameter with the request you would create another sub-directory: 

app/api/test/[testId]/route.ts

  export const GET = (
    request: NextResponse,
    { params } : { params: {testId: string}
    }) => {
      return NextResponse.json({
        hello: "this is a response message to the id: " + params.testId
      });
    }
